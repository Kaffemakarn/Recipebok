#### Notes
Please note that because we have had so many technical issues (as out superviser Daniel can attest to), the git history does not accurately represent who wrote what code. We have had to migrate the project several times between different repositories, different branches etc. and we have also done a lot of pair programming. 

## How to run

To run this application, please use **Netbeans**.

Install **Glassfish 5.0** and **postgreSQL** in netbeans and perform the neccessary configurations to get them up and running.

### Trouble shooting

If you have any problems running the application, try to *Clean and Build* first. 

Make sure your persistence file is configured correctly. 

Make sure you have a glassfish-resources.xml in your WEB-INF folder.
